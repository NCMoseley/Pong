## Setup

**Install dependencies:**

`> npm i`

**Run locally with Webpack Dev Server:**

`> npm start`

**Build for production:**

`> npm run build`

## Build

I implemented WebPack to automatically compile .js files into the final build.js. This project was an opportunity to dive deeper into understanding javascript, and using multiple scripts to make a well organized finished product. The game includes mouse control for the player paddle, and an Ai algorithm that provides a computer opponent. You can control the speed of the opponents paddle with the 'f' and 'g' keys. There is a soundtrack included that will begin when you press the letter 'm'.
